# surfs-app-express-js-server
An ExpressJs based server meant to test my skills of developing a server by myself.

## Version 0.1.1

### The main purpose of this project is to develop a full CRUD ExpressJs server. The database used is formed by some random (and funny) information about a group of friend of mine.

- Only the 'Get Random Fact' button is working now. It'll be complete soon. If you get to take a look at the info contained at this web application and think "WTF is this?", don't worry, all of those are simply internal jokes. As I told before, the main purpose is to prove that I can develop a complete ExpressJs Server by myself. =)
